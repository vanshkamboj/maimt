<p align="justify"><strong>Note:</strong> Examiner will be required  to set Nine Questions in all. First Question will be compulsory, consisting of  objective type/short-answer type questions covering the entire syllabus. In  addition to that eight more questions will be set, two questions from each  Unit. A candidate will be required to answer five questions in all, selecting  one question from each unit in addition to compulsory Question No. 1. All  questions will carry equal marks</p>
