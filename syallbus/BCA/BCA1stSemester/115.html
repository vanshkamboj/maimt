<p align="justify"><strong>Note:</strong>Examiner will be required to set Nine Questions in all. First Question will be compulsory, consisting of objective type/short-answer type questions covering the entire syllabus. In addition to that eight more questions will be set, two questions from each Unit. A candidate will be required to answer five questions in all, selecting one question from each unit in addition to compulsory Question No. 1. All questions will carry equal marks.</p>
