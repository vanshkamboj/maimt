<p><strong> Note:</strong> Examiner will be required to set NINE questions in all.  Question Number 1 will consist of total 8 parts (objective type/short-answer type questions) covering the entire syllabus and will carry 24 marks. In addition to the compulsory question there will be four units i.e. Unit-I to Unit-IV. Examiner will set two questions from each Unit of the syllabus and each question will carry 14 marks.
Student will be required to attempt FIVE questions in all. Question Number 1 will be compulsory. In addition to compulsory question, student will have to attempt four more questions selecting one question from each Unit.
